ZetaChain A pivotal aspect of the Weave6-ZetaChain partnership is the integration of Bitcoin ecosystem assets, including Ordinals NFTs, BRC20, and ARC20, into the EVM ecosystem and other smart contract chains. This initiative aims to enhance the liquidity and scalability of BTC ecosystem assets. Weave6's recent objective focuses on establishing a trading infrastructure adapter that enables efficient management of BTC ecosystem assets.
