# 1. Project Overview
## 1.1 Overview
Synbo Protocol is the world's first decentralized venture capital fund protocol based on liquidity and Position Proof, aiming to establish itself as the most efficient, transparent, and outstanding digital fund in the digital asset domain. The Alpha Synbo Meme (ASM) serves as the operational token for the Alpha prior version of Synbo Protocol, playing a crucial role in system functions and operations. By leveraging blockchain technology, the protocol focuses on creating a novel investment ecosystem that redefines the digital asset investment model.

## 1.2 Background
In the current digital asset market, two significant pain points exist. Firstly, there is a distortion between traditional capital and decentralization. Traditional investment models often face issues such as information asymmetry, high centralization, and lack of transparency, which do not align well with the decentralized ethos of the blockchain world. Secondly, Initial DEX Offerings (IDO) are often associated with a gambling - like nature, making them unsuitable for value - investment scenarios. They lack the necessary mechanisms to evaluate and promote truly valuable projects, leading to market inefficiencies and high - risk investments for participants. Synbo Protocol was born to address these issues and fill the gap in the market for a more reliable and value - oriented investment platform.

## 1.4 Project Features
- **Innovative investment fund model**: Synbo Protocol reconstructs the decentralized primary market value - investment fund to be more efficient, transparent, and fair. It breaks away from the traditional investment barriers and provides a more inclusive investment environment for all participants.
- **Dual - certificate economic model**: The community capital pool combined with the liquidity dual - certificate economic model (Position Token & Yield Token) separates decision - making power from liquidity income. This allows users to choose between participating in governance and enjoying liquidity rewards according to their own needs, improving the flexibility and fairness of the ecosystem.
- **Position Proof decision - making mechanism**: Unlike traditional consensus mechanisms, the Position Proof mechanism takes into account the user's position and contribution in the ecosystem, enabling more reasonable and representative decision - making processes.
- **Optimized distribution model**: The Community Consensus Offering (CCO) distribution mode optimizes the Token Generation Event (TGE) process. It aligns the interests of the community in the long - term, ensuring that the development of the project is driven by the community and benefits all members.
- **Enhanced trading liquidity**: By endowing the 1.5 - tier market with high - liquidity trading through equity certificates, Synbo Protocol improves the overall trading efficiency and asset liquidity in the digital asset market.
